# PyNERF
Contains implementations of NERFs and some downstream algorithms

# Use of Obsidian
A large portion of the notes I made during implementation, and notes on the papers themselves are stored in the Obsidian Vault in this directory. Go ahead and install Obsidian if yoy want to see the notes with backlinks, but they are pure Markdown so even a pure text editor should do for the basics.
